"""Unit tests for ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-whoami.sh.

Regression guard for PP-788v: `register` wrote `. + {($sid): $name}`
unconditionally, so a session_id that already held a name was silently rebound
to whatever name arrived last — and the command still printed a cheerful
"Registered:" line. The pre-existing duplicate-name check only covered the
FORWARD direction (this name is held by a different sid); the reverse
direction (this sid already holds a different name) was unguarded.

Observed live 2026-07-31: three consecutive dispatched subagents each
overwrote the orchestrator's mapping for the orchestrator's OWN session_id,
because a subagent has no route to its own id and gets handed the parent's.
That broke the orchestrator's self-filter (its own posts re-injected as a
peer's) and misattributed its huddle comments — including to the user.

Two guards are under test:
  1. the reverse-direction collision refusal (harness-agnostic, --force
     overrides for a genuine rename);
  2. the subagent refusal on `register` and `discover`, keyed off the caller's
     transcript path. No --force override — there is no correct id for a
     subagent to supply.

Guard 2 used to key off the env pair CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION + an AI_AGENT
ending in `_agent`, on the belief that Claude Code seeds those only into a
dispatch. It does not: the CLI puts both into the environment of EVERY shell
the Bash tool spawns, so from 2026-08-08 the predicate was true for top-level
sessions too and every Claude session on the machine was locked out of
registering (PP-uxnn). A top-level session and a dispatched subagent were
measured to carry byte-identical AI_AGENT, CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION and
CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID values — there is no env-level discriminator, so the
guard now looks at where the harness recorded the call: <project>/<sid>.jsonl
for a top-level session, <project>/<sid>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl for a
dispatch. Both directions are covered below.

Each test builds a throwaway git repo so `huddle_state_dir` resolves to
<repo>/.agents/huddle, then runs the script with an explicit env.
