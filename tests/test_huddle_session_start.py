"""Unit tests for ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-session-start.sh.

Regression guard for PP-2m3l: the rotation-needed branch used to `exit 0` right
after printing its notice, which made the identity / registration block below it
unreachable. SessionStart fires exactly once per session, so every session that
started on a new day *before* rotation ran never learned its session_id and never
registered — breaking the huddle self-filter (a session saw its own posts injected
back as if from a peer) and degrading post attribution.

Rotation and registration are independent concerns: a session start with rotation
pending must emit BOTH blocks.

Each test builds a throwaway git repo (so huddle_state_dir resolves to
<repo>/.agents/huddle), stubs `bd` on PATH to serve canned JSON per bead id, pipes
a SessionStart payload on stdin, and asserts on the hook's stdout.
