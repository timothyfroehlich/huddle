"""Unit tests for ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-digest.sh (PP-llkj).

The digest answers "what kind of work is this project doing right now" at
session start, including after compaction. It is deliberately derived from the
local git object store alone — no LLM, no network, no `bd` — so these tests are
just: build a throwaway repo with known commits and branches, run the script,
assert on the rendered block.

The properties worth pinning down are the ones a reader relies on:
  - counts are honest even when the bullet list is truncated
  - dependency-bump churn collapses instead of crowding out real work
  - non-conventional and multi-scope (dependabot) subjects don't fall through
  - branch noise (trunk, dependabot, worktree-agent-*) stays out of "in flight"
  - anything unexpected degrades to empty output, never to a broken hook
