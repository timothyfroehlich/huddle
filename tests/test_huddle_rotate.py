"""Unit tests for the pre-rotation verified pull in ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-rotate.sh.

Regression guard for PP-1d51: on 2026-07-07 the Mac ran a huddle rotation while
its local beads Dolt had diverged from the remote. The pre-rotation pull failed on
a merge conflict, but rotation continued fail-open and minted the daily bead off a
STALE local child counter — producing an id (PP-lt12.38) that already existed on
the remote, an unmergeable cross-machine Dolt conflict.

The fix makes that pull VERIFIED: if the pull fails AND the output mentions a merge
conflict, rotation aborts (non-zero exit, clear stderr) before allocating any child
id. Offline/unreachable (a non-zero pull with no conflict wording) stays fail-open —
a single active machine cannot collide, and rotation must still work without a
network.

Each test builds a throwaway git repo (so huddle_state_dir resolves to
<repo>/.agents/huddle), stubs `bd` on PATH to record its invocations and emit canned
JSON, runs huddle-rotate.sh as a subprocess, and asserts on the exit code plus
whether `bd create` was invoked (inspected via the BD_LOG).
