# Harness-agnostic. Identity is keyed by the agent's session_id (a UUID
# supplied by the harness — Claude Code's session_id, Antigravity's

# the registered repository's XDG agent state so every session can be
# inspected/edited from one place and the mapping persists across restarts.
# See huddle-lib.sh for the state-dir resolver.
#
# Names should embed the harness as a prefix (e.g. `Claude-DesignBible`,
# `Antigravity-AgentsMdCleanup`, `Codex-TestAudit`) so the user can recognize
# which agent stack each parallel session belongs to. The huddle self-filter
# uses the full registered name when matching `—<name>` sign-offs.

# Subcommands:
#   whoami SESSION_ID        Print the registered name for SESSION_ID. Exits 1

#   register [--force] NAME SESSION_ID
#                            Add SESSION_ID → NAME to the JSON map. Refuses to
#                            rebind a SESSION_ID that already holds a DIFFERENT
#                            name unless --force is passed. Exits 1 with usage
#                            if SESSION_ID is omitted.
#   list                     Dump all session_id → name pairs (sorted by name).
#   discover                 Print the session_id of the calling shell. Uses
#                            $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID when set (exact), then
#                            $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID as a fallback for other
#                            harnesses, then the transcript heuristic with a
#                            warning (Claude Code only; see WARNING below).
#                            Refuses for subagents.
#
# OWNERSHIP — a session_id is owned by whoever registered it first. `register`
# guards BOTH directions of collision:
#   - name → other sid: the name is taken; pick a different one (no override).
#   - sid → other name: refuse the rebind; --force overrides, for the genuine
#     "I want to rename my own session" case.
# The second guard is the fix for PP-788v. The write used to be an
# unconditional `. + {($sid): $name}` — last writer won, silently, and printed
# a cheerful success line. On 2026-07-31 three consecutive subagents each
# overwrote the orchestrator's mapping for the orchestrator's OWN session_id,
# which broke its self-filter (it saw its own posts re-injected as a peer's)
# and misattributed its huddle comments to the subagents — even to the user.
#
# WARNING — the transcript-based session_id discovery is a Claude-Code-specific
# best-effort heuristic. It reads ~/.claude/projects/<mangled-root>/<session_id>.jsonl,
# the transcript location Claude Code uses. Other harnesses (Antigravity,
# Codex, etc.) do not write transcripts there and MUST pass session_id
# explicitly — their bootstrap shims already do (see
# global Antigravity adapter). Even within Claude Code the
# heuristic is racy when multiple sessions are active: it returns the newest
# transcript, which is wrong for any non-newest session (2026-05-20 incident
# on PP-lt12 — root cause of PP-sjkz). SESSION_ID is therefore REQUIRED for
# whoami and register; the discover subcommand invokes the heuristic only
# when the caller explicitly requests it and $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID is absent.

# Is the calling process a dispatched Claude Code subagent (`Agent({...})`)?
#
# A subagent CANNOT learn its own session_id, so it must never register:
#   - $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID is seeded with the PARENT's id;
#   - discover_session_id above returns the newest TOP-LEVEL transcript, which
#     excludes subagents/ by construction — so also the parent's;
#   - the scratchpad path handed to a subagent embeds the parent's UUID.
# Every available route yields the parent's id (PP-788v). Telling agents to
# "use your own id" was tried twice and failed both times, because the value
# it asks for does not exist anywhere in a subagent's environment.
#
# DETECTION IS BY TRANSCRIPT PATH, NOT BY ENV (PP-uxnn). The original guard
# keyed off CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION plus an AI_AGENT ending in `_agent`, on
# the belief that Claude Code seeds those only into a dispatch. It does not.
# The CLI builds the environment of EVERY shell the Bash tool spawns with
#   T2t({sessionId: <session id>, effortLevel: …, source: "agent"})
# and `source: "agent"` there means "the model is spawning this process" — any
# tool call — not "dispatched subagent". So both markers are present in a
# top-level session's Bash shell too, the predicate was true for everyone, and
# from 2026-08-08 every Claude session on the machine was locked out of
# registering. (Verified on 2.1.224/225/226; a top-level session and a
# dispatched subagent were measured to have byte-identical values for
# AI_AGENT, CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION and CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID. There is no
# env-level discriminator.)
#
# The docs say the same thing, and are the durable citation now that the
# reasoning above rests on a minified bundle that will be shaped differently
# next release. Per https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars.md,
# CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION is "set to 1 in subprocesses Claude Code spawns
# via the Bash, PowerShell, and Monitor tools, hook commands, and status line
# commands" — every Bash-tool shell, not a dispatch marker. Its actual purpose
# is unrelated to subagents: it "distinguishes a nested claude session from a
# top-level claude launched in an IDE-integrated terminal", so a nested TUI is
# excluded from --resume, --continue and `claude agents`. AI_AGENT appears
# nowhere in the documentation at all — the old guard rested half on a
# misread variable and half on an undocumented internal. No documented
# variable distinguishes a dispatched subagent from its parent.
#
# What IS different is where the harness records the call. Claude Code writes
# a top-level session's transcript to <project>/<session>.jsonl and a
# dispatched subagent's to <project>/<session>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl — the
# same `*/subagents/*` signal huddle-poll.sh and huddle-session-start.sh
# already use, which they get free from their hook payload. A script invoked
# from the Bash tool has to find its own record instead: the tool_use for the
# running command is USUALLY flushed to the CALLING agent's transcript before
# the command executes, so the newest record naming this script identifies the
# caller.
#
# "Usually" is load-bearing and was originally written as a certainty. The
# flush is not guaranteed — a top-level `discover` was observed running with
# its own record still unwritten. So the newest record is only trusted when it
# is also RECENT (see WHOAMI_FRESH_SECONDS); otherwise the read is treated as
# indeterminate. Nothing here is a security boundary — it picks between a
# clear error message and a confusing one, and `register`'s rebind guard is
# what actually prevents the damage.
#
# Fails open by design, in both the old sense and a new one: other harnesses
# (Antigravity, Codex) do not write these transcripts and are unaffected, and
# an indeterminate read — no matching record, an unrecognised layout, an
# invocation wrapped in another script — is treated as "not a subagent" and
# falls back to the harness-agnostic rebind guard in `register`.

# The literal that must appear in the caller's recorded command. Every
# documented invocation is `bash <huddle>/lib/huddle-whoami.sh …` typed by the
# agent, so the script's filename is in the command string verbatim.
WHOAMI_SIGNATURE=$(basename "$0")

# Regex for a command that RUNS this script, as opposed to one that merely
# names it. `contains($sig)` is not enough: `rg -n discover
# <huddle>/lib/huddle-whoami.sh` contains the signature and is a Bash tool_use,
# but reading the file is not invoking it — and an agent researching this guard
# does exactly that. Both misreadings are live: a subagent that greps the file
# makes its parent look like a subagent, and a parent that cats it makes a real
# subagent look top-level.
#
# So the signature must sit in COMMAND POSITION: at the start of the command,
# on a new LINE, or after a `;`/`&`/`|` separator, optionally behind a
# `bash`/`sh` prefix, and optionally behind a directory path. As an argument to
# some other program it does not count.
#
# The newline in the separator class is load-bearing. jq's Oniguruma runs with
# ONIG_OPTION_SINGLELINE, so `^` means START OF STRING, not start of line —
# without `\n` here, a multi-line command matched nothing at all, and 17.5% of
# real Bash tool_use commands in this project's transcripts are multi-line
# (117 of 669 across the 8 newest). A subagent running the ordinary
# `cd "$REPO"\nbash <huddle>/lib/huddle-whoami.sh register …` was classified
# top-level and could clobber the parent's mapping — the PP-788v path. Every
# INVOCATIONS test case was single-line, so the suite stayed green through it.
#
# Known and accepted gap: a wrapper prefix other than bash/sh (`timeout 5 bash
# …`, `env FOO=1 …`) still misses. That is the fail-OPEN direction, caught by
# `register`'s rebind guard, and widening the pattern to chase it would risk
# false positives, which have no backstop and lock a session out.

# How many trailing records to scan. The caller's tool_use is normally the LAST

# records measured in this project's transcripts. A window of 5 sat exactly at

WHOAMI_TAIL_RECORDS=25

# How recent a record must be to count as evidence about the process running

#
# Without this bound the guard reads STALE evidence and refuses a legitimate
# top-level session (PP-uxnn, second bug). The flush of the caller's own
# tool_use is not guaranteed to happen before the command executes — measured
# live: a top-level `discover` whose record had not yet been written lost to an
# 18-minute-old record left in a subagent transcript by an earlier dispatch,
# and the session was told it was a subagent. Any session that has ever
# dispatched a subagent touching this script was one unflushed write away from
# being locked out, which is the exact failure this detection replaced.
#
# A real caller's record is written moments before the command runs, so a
# generous bound separates the two cases cleanly. Anything older is not
# evidence about this process and is ignored, which degrades to "indeterminate"
# — deliberately the fail-OPEN direction, backstopped by the rebind guard in
# `register`.
WHOAMI_FRESH_SECONDS=120

# jq program: newest epoch-MILLISECONDS among the input records that record an
# actual Bash invocation of this script, or nothing. $re is
# WHOAMI_INVOCATION_RE.
#
# THE MATCH MUST BE STRUCTURAL, NOT A SUBSTRING OF THE LINE. A raw
# `grep -F huddle-whoami.sh` over the JSONL matches any record that merely
# mentions the path, which is not the same claim at all. Measured in a live
# transcript, the raw grep's matches in one 25-record window were a
# `file-history-snapshot`, a `queue-operation` and a `user` message — and NOT
# ONE was a Bash tool_use invoking the script. Editing this file is enough to
# produce matching records. Both misreadings are reachable: a subagent that
# merely greps the file makes the parent look like a subagent (the PP-uxnn
# lockout again), and a parent that merely cats it makes a real subagent look
# top-level (the PP-788v clobber). So: require a tool_use block, name Bash, and
# the signature inside input.command.
#
# Milliseconds are kept. Truncating to whole seconds made same-second records
# compare equal, and the caller's loop keeps the FIRST candidate on a tie —
# always the top-level transcript — so a genuine subagent record 0.4s newer
# than an unrelated parent record silently lost. The bias was systematic in the

    # gets that, even having exported its own. Documented as the lesser of two
    # imperfect options: making it win would let one stale value in a shell
    # profile silently misroute every session on the machine, which is the
    # failure mode this file already has two regressions for. A harness that
    # needs certainty passes the id as an argument — the documented route, and
    # what global Antigravity adapter does.

    # that the result may be wrong when multiple sessions are active
    # concurrently (PP-bh7w).
