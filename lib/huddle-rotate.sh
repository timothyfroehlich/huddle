# huddle-rotate.sh — daily coordination bead rotation, phase A (shell atomic).
#
# Phase A (this script) performs the atomic shell work:
#   1. Acquire exclusive lock on <STATE_DIR>/rotation.lock (60s timeout)
#   2. Re-check date inside the lock (exit 0 if peer already rotated)
#   3. Create new daily bead (+ monthly if month rolled) under root
#   4. Atomically update root notes JSON with new pointers
#   5. Post "→ continued in <new-bead>" comments on old beads (best-effort)
#   6. Print phase-B handoff variables to stdout
#
# Phase B (LLM summarization, old-bead archiving, closing, name-prune) is
# performed by the dispatching subagent after reading phase A stdout.
# Dispatch template: ~/.claude/skills/huddle/SKILL.md §rotation.
#
# Crash-safety: steps 1-4 are the "make consistent" path. If the process dies
# between step 4 and step 5, root notes already point to the new beads — the
# system is consistent. Old bead has no summary, but the next rotation subagent
# can back-fill it before proceeding with the current rotation.
#
# Usage:
#   output=$(bash ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-rotate.sh)
#   # parse key=value lines:
#   OLD_TODAY_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$output" | grep '^OLD_TODAY=' | cut -d= -f2-)
#   OLD_MONTHLY_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$output" | grep '^OLD_MONTHLY=' | cut -d= -f2-)
#   NEW_TODAY_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$output" | grep '^NEW_TODAY=' | cut -d= -f2-)
#   NEW_MONTHLY_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$output" | grep '^NEW_MONTHLY=' | cut -d= -f2-)
#
# Exits 0 with no output if rotation is not needed (peer already rotated).
