# huddle-session-start.sh — SessionStart hook: announce session_id and registration state
#
# Harness-agnostic. Fires at session start from any agent harness that supports
# SessionStart-equivalent hooks (Claude Code via .claude/settings.json,
# Antigravity via global Antigravity adapter, etc.). Reads stdin JSON
# for `session_id`, looks up the session's registered name in the resolved XDG
# agent state (see huddle-lib.sh), and emits a brief identity block on stdout which the
# host harness surfaces as system context.
#
# Why this exists: agents can't reliably discover their own session_id when
# multiple parallel sessions are active. The SessionStart hook is the only
# place session_id is guaranteed-correct without an external diagnostic.
#
# Pairs with ~/.agents/huddle/huddle-poll.sh — that's the new-comment injection
# hook; this one is just identity announcement.
#
# Stdin payload schema (Claude Code shape; other harnesses adapt to this via
# their bootstrap shim — see global Antigravity adapter for the
# Antigravity adapter):
#   {
#     "session_id":       "<UUID>",
#     "transcript_path":  "<path to .jsonl>",
#     "cwd":              "<current working dir>",
#     "hook_event_name":  "SessionStart",
#     "source":           "startup" | "resume" | "clear" | "compact",
#     "model":            "<model id>",                       (Claude-only, optional)
#     "agent_type":       "<name>"  (optional, when launched with --agent)
#   }
#
# On `source=compact` we emit a condensed block instead of the full one: the
# agent saw the verbose registration/etiquette text pre-compaction, but the
# compaction summary is not guaranteed to carry its huddle name, today's bead
# id, or any sense of what the project has been working on — and a compacted
# session is exactly the one most likely to post nothing for the rest of its
# life. So compact gets: identity one-liner, posting reminder, work digest.
# (PP-llkj. Before that, compact got nothing at all.)

# --- herdr workspace label (PP-355h) ---
# The human-meaningful name for a session already exists: the label the user typed on
# its herdr workspace. Deriving the huddle name from it is what keeps the huddle
# name, the Claude Code display name, and the sidebar entry recognizably the same
# session instead of three unrelated strings.
#
# Read it from $HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID, NOT by matching panes. Hooks inherit the
# environment of the shell herdr launched the agent in, so this variable is
# present and identifies the workspace directly. The alternatives are both worse:
# `herdr pane list`'s agent_session.value has been measured pointing at a
# different live session (see the herdr skill), and terminal_title carries an
# animating spinner glyph that terminal_title_stripped does not fully remove
# (✳ and the braille frames yes, ◐/◑ no).
#
# $HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID goes stale in three ways, all inherited from
# $HERDR_PANE_ID: a forked session, a handoff, and a **moved pane**. The moved
# pane is the one that misleads, because the lookup is live-by-id: it returns the
# *current* label of a *different* workspace, so the notice offers a perfectly
# plausible name belonging to someone else's task rather than an obviously stale
# one. Tolerable here and nowhere else in the huddle, because the output is a
# *suggestion* the agent and the user both read before it is registered — not a
# signature attributed silently.
#
# HARD TIMEOUT, and this is not optional. `.claude/settings.json` gives this hook
# 5000ms and it already runs ~4s; `herdr workspace list` is a socket read against
# a server that can wedge. Blowing the budget is not "no label" — Claude Code
# kills the hook and discards ALL of its stdout, so the session gets no
# session_id and no registration prompt and never registers, which is the
# PP-2m3l self-filter breakage. The call measures ~9ms, so 1s is generous.
# With neither timeout binary present we skip the lookup rather than run it
# unbounded: a missing suggestion costs a nicer name, a hung hook costs identity.
