# huddle-poll.sh — poll PP-cvh for new coordination comments and inject them
#
# Harness-agnostic. Fires from per-harness hook configurations:
#   - Claude Code:  UserPromptSubmit (no throttle) + PostToolUse (throttled),
#                   registered in .claude/settings.json
#   - Antigravity:  mid-trajectory invocation via global Antigravity adapter
#   - Other harnesses: route through their own bootstrap shim
# Outputs new comments as a system-reminder block on stdout, or nothing if
# nothing is new (zero stdout = no injection).
#
# Stdin payload schema (Claude Code shape; other harnesses adapt to this via
# their bootstrap shim):
#   UserPromptSubmit:
#     { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name,
#       permission_mode, prompt }
#   PostToolUse:
#     { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name,
#       permission_mode, tool_name, tool_input, tool_response }
# We only read session_id and transcript_path (the latter for subagent
# detection); other fields are ignored.
#
# Throttle (slow-path harnesses only): set HUDDLE_THROTTLE_SECONDS=N in the
# hook command line to gate the slow path to once per N seconds per worktree.
# When unset/zero, the throttle block is skipped entirely → identical to
# pre-throttle behavior. The fast-path skip is the dominant cost path during
# active tool-call bursts; target wall clock <30ms (one date +%s spawn).
#
# Throttle marker: <agent-state>/last-poll-<worktree-key>, one line of epoch
# seconds. Written on every slow-path entry (whether or not new comments
# were found) — "I polled and there was nothing" is still a poll. Written
# BEFORE the bd fetch so that bd-broken states still get backoff instead
# of triggering one hammer per tool call.
#
# State file: <agent-state>/last-seen-<sha256-of-worktree-root>
#   Per-checkout cursor advancing only when new comments are injected.
#   Shared across all linked worktrees AND all harnesses via huddle-lib.sh's
#   git-common-dir resolver.
#
# Self-filter (auto, no env config required): the stdin payload carries a
# `session_id` field. The hook looks up the agent's name from
# <agent-state>/session-names.json (a JSON
# `{session_id: name}` map). Comments ending with `—<name>` are excluded
# from injection so an agent never re-sees its own coordination posts.
# Registered names should embed the harness (e.g. `Claude-DesignBible`,
# `Antigravity-AgentsMdCleanup`); the sign-off is `—<full-name>`. For
# backward compat the filter also accepts `—Claude-<name>` for older
# unprefixed registrations.
#
# To register a session→name mapping:
#   bash <huddle>/lib/huddle-whoami.sh register <Name> <session_id>
#
# Backward compat: also accepts the $CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME env var (the original
# activation scheme); harnesses other than Claude Code should pass session_id
# explicitly via the stdin payload and register through huddle-whoami.sh.
#
# Naming guidance: pick a short descriptive name prefixed with your harness
# (e.g. Claude-WorktreeHookFix, Antigravity-TestAudit, Codex-DesignBible).
# Full reference: `~/.claude/skills/huddle/SKILL.md`.
