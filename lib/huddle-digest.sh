# huddle-digest.sh — "what we've been working on" digest for the last N days
#
# Prints a compact, skimmable block describing the *shape* of recent work:
# what merged to main grouped by work type, and which branches are currently
# alive. Called by huddle-session-start.sh on every session start, including
# after compaction.
#
# Why this exists (PP-llkj): session-start used to inject five daily-bead
# descriptions, which are written in a "Merged / In-flight / Discoveries /
# Blockers" shape. Read cold, that lands as a log of everything that recently
# broke. A session opening (or waking up post-compaction) needs the opposite
# framing first: what kind of work is this project doing right now, and what
# just landed. The dailies still follow — trimmed — for day-scale detail.
#
# Deterministic by design: everything here comes from the local git object
# store. No LLM, no network, no `bd` call, no `gh` call. It must be safe to run
# on every SessionStart in every worktree, so it never fetches — `origin/main`
# is read as-is and the block states which commit date it actually covers, so a
# stale remote ref reads as stale rather than as "nothing happened".
#
# Usage:
#   bash <huddle>/lib/huddle-digest.sh [--days N] [--max-items N] [--no-branches]
#
# Exits 0 with no output when there is nothing to report (not a git repo, no
# commits in range, git missing). Callers can capture stdout and skip the
# section entirely when it comes back empty.
